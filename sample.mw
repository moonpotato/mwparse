## Subheading

Note that both the headings and this paragraph are separated by a
blank line. This is necessary.

>> Now we create an @indented block@. Recall, only the first line
   should have the block markers. My editor has kindly aligned the
   paragraph to those markers, but that isn't necessary.
>>
>> We create a new paragraph block, but maintain the previous
   indentation. The above line's block specifier must be a subset of
   the first block specifier (in this case, that means `>>` or
   nothing).
>>
>> % This block here is centred, as well, still within the main
   indented block.

The above is an /asterism/, one of the default styles of section
break. The other is just a straight ruled line.

>>> This is the most indented level.$
Here we've used `$` to force line breaks,$
but these need not be at$ the end of line themselves,$
as seen here.

There are a number of symbol replacements aimed at simple typesetting
as well. "Speech marks" automatically become left and right versions
(and single, due to the author's British English upbringing --- use
""double"" for double quotes, although this can be changed). Three
hyphens --- em dash, two -- en. Ellipsis... ~Crossed out **bold**
text.~

% The default also handles changing < > and & to HTML entities. The
  author recommends leaving this.
