        Sample MWParse File
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Subheading
      </h2>
      <p class="gap">
        Note that both the headings and this paragraph are separated by a
        blank line. This is necessary.
      </p>
      <div class="indent i2">
        <p class="gap">
          Now we create an <span class="toupper">indented block</span>. Recall, only the first line
          should have the block markers. My editor has kindly aligned the
          paragraph to those markers, but that isn&rsquo;t necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="gap">
          We create a new paragraph block, but maintain the previous
          indentation. The above line&rsquo;s block specifier must be a subset of
          the first block specifier (in this case, that means >> or
          nothing).
        </p>
        <div class="centre">
          <p class="gap">
            This block here is centred, as well, still within the main
            indented block.
          </p>
        </div>

      <p class="gap">
        The above is an <i>asterism</i>, one of the default styles of section
        break. The other is just a straight ruled line.
      </p>
      <p class="gap">
        <hr>

      <div class="indent i3">
        <p class="gap">
          This is the most indented level.<br>
          Here we&rsquo;ve used $ to force line breaks,<br>
          but these need not be at<br> the end of line themselves,<br>
          as seen here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="gap">
        <hr class="ast">
      </p>
      <p class="gap">
        There are a number of symbol replacements aimed at simple typesetting
        as well. &lsquo;Speech marks&rsquo; automatically become left and right versions
        (and single, due to the author&rsquo;s British English upbringing &mdash; use
        &ldquo;double&rdquo; for double quotes, although this can be changed). Three
        hyphens &mdash; em dash, two &ndash; en. Ellipsis&hellip; <del>Crossed out <strong>bold</strong>
        text.</del>
      </p>
      <div class="centre">
        <p class="gap">
          The default also handles changing &lt; &gt; and &amp; to HTML entities. The
          author recommends leaving this.
